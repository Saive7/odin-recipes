    <p>These porcupine meatballs are by far the best I have ever had. This recipe was given to my mom when she married back in 1970. The recipe includes directions for stovetop cooking and baking in the oven. I hope you enjoy it as much as our family does.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>⅓ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon celery salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup water, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix ground beef, rice, 1/2 cup water, onion, salt, celery salt, garlic powder, and black pepper in a bowl. Roll mixture into 12 meatballs.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place meatballs into the hot skillet; cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned. Drain and discard excess grease.</li>
        <li>Pour tomato sauce, 1 cup water, and Worcestershire sauce into the skillet; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until meatballs are no longer pink in the center and rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Stir in more water if sauce becomes too dry.</li>
    </ol>
